        A post is an arrow that loops around to point back at itself.
        <br/><br/>
        A link is an arrow that connects two other different arrows.
        <br/><br/>
        This means that links are real objects like posts.
        Links have their own content,
        and you can reply to them and link between them.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Click</b> on a link to check out the resemblence between posts and links.
        <br/><br/>
        Hint: When a link is closed, it displays the number of upvotes it has.
      </IonCardContent>
